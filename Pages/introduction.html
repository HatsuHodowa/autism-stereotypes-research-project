				<h1>Purpose</h1>
				<p>As was mentioned at the start of the survey, my primary goal behind this research is to find what perspectives and potential stereotypes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common among university students (at UNCCH specifically) and among the general public overall.</p>
				<p>In the process of analyzing the data I received, I decided to break this further down into 5 different research questions that the data collected by this survey could potentially answer. However, due to a time limitation for this project, I was only able to partially investigate one of these questions: <em>How do perspectives of ASD differ or remain the same across the different communities being surveyed?</em></p>
				<p>The other research questions I had hoped to investigate are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How do perspectives of ASD differ or remain the same among the different age groups being surveyed?</li>
					<li>How do perspectives of ASD differ or remain the same among people who have completed different levels of education in the US?</li>
					<li>How do perspectives of ASD differ or remain the same among people with different areas of study during their time in education?</li>
					<li>How do perspectives of ASD differ or remain the same among those with different relationships to ASD (i.e., being diagnosed, considering it, having been diagnosed with Aspergerâ€™s, knowing someone with ASD, etc.)?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My analysis of this data has thusly been done in order to answer that first question about differences in surveyed communities. For anyone interested in seeing the results for the other research questions I posed, or for your own questions of interest, the data is available for download in the "data" tab at the top.</p>
