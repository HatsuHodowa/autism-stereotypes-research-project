				<h1>Disclaimers</h1>
				<p>There are a number of disclaimers to be made about the results of this survey and the generalizability of these results, which I will try my best to point out here.</p>
				<p>For one, given the limited data collected, it is difficult to generalize many of the trends found in this data to the broader populations in question.</p>
				<p>Below is a list of all survey groups included in this study, along with how many respondents were in each group:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Scanners of QR code around campus:</strong> Nobody scanned the QR code around campus. This was likely due to the limited time span QR codes were available (around 3-4 days), as well as a potential limited interest or knowledge of the study and its content. As there were no respondents in this category, it will not be included in further analysis of the data collected.</li>
					<li><strong>r/UNC subreddit:</strong> 29 respondents</li>
					<li><strong>r/SampleSize subreddit:</strong> 53 respondents</li>
					<li><strong>r/Autism subreddit:</strong> 6 respondents</li>
					<li><strong>r/AutisticAdults subreddit:</strong> 3 respondents</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As the number of respondents for both the r/Autism subreddit and the r/AutisticAdults subreddit is quite low, it is difficult to generalize the results from those respondents to their entire respective populations.</p>
				<p>Additionally, as goes for all respondents by the nature of a volunteer, unpaid internet survey, there is likely a sampling bias in these results due to more individuals with higher interest in the topic of ASD responding than those without.</p>
				<p>All in all, however, I will focus my analysis primarily on the r/UNC and r/SampleSize groups, as those were the largest respondent groups and are the most generalizable.</p>

				<h1>How do perspectives of ASD differ or remain the same across the different communities being surveyed?</h1>
				<p>To answer this question, I decided to compare the results of the matrix question from the survey, asking participants to rate each statement with whether they agreed, disagreed, or neither.</p>

				<p>I won't analyze all of these results in detail, just for time's sake, but I will point out a few that stood out to me. I also will primarily be analyzing the difference between the r/UNC and r/SampleSize subreddits, as the sample sizes of the other populations are likely too small to make any kind of generalization to the broader population.</p>
				<p>Those on the r/UNC subreddit were more likely than those on r/SampleSize to choose either "Agree" or "Disagree" rather than "Neither agree nor disagree" on a number of the characteristics, including mentally challenged, lacking empathy, more aggressive, and short-tempered. It's hard to say that this is a general trend, however, as many others resulted in r/SampleSize being more opinionated one way or the other instead, such as with intelligent, moodier, less intelligent, and unexpressive.</p>
				<p>One particularly interesting trend I want to point out is with the "intelligent" and "less intelligent" questions regarding Autistic people or people with ASD. Those on r/SampleSize were more likely to agree that Autistic people or people with ASD are intelligent, and more likely to disagree that Autistic people or people with ASD are less intelligent. Not a single person from r/SampleSize agreed that autistic people are "less intelligent".</p>

				<p>According to Douwe Draaisma in his article, "Stereotypes of autism", published in May 2009, "In quite a few cases, media representations of talent and special abilities can be said to have contributed to a harmful divergence between the general image of autism and the clinical reality of the autistic condition." What Draaisma is touching on here could almost be called a sort of "romantization" of autism or ASD, regarding the idea that it comes with bizarre "special abilities" or high levels of intelligence.</p>
				<p>A lot of this likely originates from savantism, a condition said to be related to autism. According to Darold A. Treffert, "[s]avant syndrom is a rare, but extraordinary, condition in which persons with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, have some 'island of genius' which stands in marked, incongruous contrast to overall handicap." Essentially, it's a condition where someone who is cognitively challenged in many ways, often involving autism, has some sort of special skill or area where they excel to a much greater degree than average.</p>
				<p>The issue with the media portrayal of autism, however, is the overemphasis on savantism. "Even if savantism mostly comes with autism, the majority of cases of autism do not have savantism . . . In movies, however, there are hardly any autistic characters <em>not</em> having savant skills," (Draaisma).</p>
				<p>I believe the trend found in this data regarding intelligence could be due, at least in some part, to this media influence on common perspectives of autism.</p>

				<h1>Final Comments of Survey Responders</h1>
				<p>At the very end of this survey was a "final comments/feedback" sort of question, where respondents were able to mention any feedback for the survey, make comments about their responses, etcetera. Reading through these final comments, I started to notice a few interesting trends that I decided to point out here.</p>
				<p>Before analyzing these comments, however, I decided to categorize them. Each category was intended to briefly summarize the topic of interest of hte comment being made, and, in cases where it felt necessary, I assigned multiple categories to a single response so as to fully encompass everything mentioned in that response. The categories I developed, in no particular order, are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Pro-survey</strong> - These people responded with messages excited about the results of the survey or overall in favor of the survey itself.</li>
					<li><strong>Difficult to decide</strong> - These people made comments about how many of the questions were difficult to decide on.</li>
					<li><strong>Autism varies</strong> - These people made comments about how much autism varies from person to person.</li>
					<li><strong>Encouragement/congratulations</strong> - These people simply provided encouragement for me with my class project, or congratulated me for other things related to COMM 89 class.</li>
					<li><strong>No comment</strong> - These people either left the final comment section blank or specified that they had nothing more to add.</li>
					<li><strong>Anti-self-diagnosis</strong> - These people made final comments that were against self-diagnosis of autism and/or those who practice it.</li>
					<li><strong>Well-versed in autism</strong> - These people made comments about their familiarity with autism, how long they’ve known about it or known people with it, and/or how involved they’ve been in learning about it.</li>
					<li><strong>Gender bias in diagnosis</strong> - These people mentioned something about the sexism involved in autism diagnosis and how research and diagnosis have been geared towards men more than women.</li>
					<li><strong>Old people less likely to choose diagnosis</strong> - These people mentioned something about older people being less likely to choose to seek diagnosis.</li>
					<li><strong>Autism and methylation</strong> - These people mentioned something about research relating autism to methylation issues. I assume what they were referring to is similar to what this <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/dna-methylation-in-autism-explained/?fspec=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article on DNA methylation in autism</a> is discussing, but I could be wrong.</li>
					<li><strong>Shock at perspectives of autism</strong> - These people mentioned that they were shocked or surprised by the current perspectives of autism.</li>
					<li><strong>Is high-functioning</strong> - These people mentioned something about being autistic but “high-functioning”.</li>
					<li><strong>Mention of famous autistic people</strong> - These people mentioned something about one or more famous people with autism or autistic people.</li>
					<li><strong>Comment on grammar</strong> - These people made one or more comments about the grammar and/or English (more generally) of the survey questions.</li>
					<li><strong>Broader choice scale</strong> - These people requested a broader choice scale for the choices beyond just “Agree”, “Neither agree nor disagree”, and “Disagree”.</li>
					<li><strong>More questions on Asperger’s</strong> - These people requested including more questions on Asperger’s Syndrome rather than just ASD.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The results of these categorizations are below:</p>
				<img src="../Media/final comments.png" class="medium-image" style="width: 800px;">
				<p>I didn't include those without comments, but the "no comment" category totaled up to 70, meaning 70 individual people did not add additional comments. Note that the sum of all categories will add up to more than the total number of respondents as a result of assigning multiple categories to individual responses.</p>
				<p>As you can see though, the 3 most common categories mentioned in this "final comments" question are that the questions were difficult to answer, they were excited for the survey or otherwise supported it, or that autism varies from person to person, which was usually mentioned as an explanation for why the questions were difficult to answer.</p>
				<p>The reason I wanted to point out these trend was because I believe it showcases an important flaw in all of the characteristics and statements throughout this survey. That flaw is that each of the characteristics mentioned vary on an individual level, regardless of whether or not a person has autism. No single person with autism is going to display the same traits and characteristics, because every person with autism is in fact exactly that: an individual, unique person.</p>
				<p>This is not to mention the variation found within ASD as a whole. There is a degree of controversy around the recent modifications to the DSM which combined Asperger's and a variety of other related conditions into the broader autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and many were either diagnosed with Asperger's originally, before the diagnostic standard was changed, or prefer to refer to themselves as Asperger's rather than ASD due to feeling a closer relation to what are considered "Asperger's characteristics" versus "autistic characteristics".</p>
				<p>Gordon Gates, in his book, published in 2019, titled <em><a href="https://us.jkp.com/products/trauma-stigma-and-autism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trauma, Stigma, and Autism: Developing Resilience and Loosening the Grip of Shame</a></em>, even makes the distinction between two major "types" of autism: Asperger's Syndrom and High Funcitoning Autism (ASHFA) and Classical Autism With High Support Need (CLAWHS). He then continues to focus primarily on ASHFA throughout his book as he himself was originally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.</p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>Although there were many aspects of this data that I was unable to analyze due to time constraints, such as the impact of education level, potential variation of responses as a result of familiarity with autism, and more, I believe this study shows just how varied ASD is and the innefficiency of labels and stereotypes to fully portray the autistic person, or the inability of a single person to fully portray the autism spectrum.</p>
				<p>Results for these questions were pretty varied, and "Neither disagree nor agree" was definitely a popular choice, which further goes to show the variation of autism as well as the perspectives and potential stereotypes surrounding it.</p>
				<p>As mentioned a little bit in the introduction page, interesting further research to do on this topic, both with the data I have already collected as well as with new data yet to be collected—perhaps from a more general audience—could focus on how age, completed education level, areas of study, and relationships to ASD all potentially impact perspectives of autism. For anyone interested in answering questions that were not answered in my analysis of this study, again the data collected is available in the data tab on the navigation bar at the top.</p>
